Local refs: /Users/MN/GITHUB/.knowledge/curated-docs-repo/ericbuess-claude-code-docs and /Users/MN/GITHUB/.knowledge/curated-code-repo/openai-codex.\n\nWhat MN pushed back on (important):\n- \u2018cacophony\u2019 is a named failure mode (runaway stream-of-consciousness), but it is NOT the main problem. The main problem is stop/go + manual relaying. So don\u2019t over-index on constraints; prioritize fluidity + visibility (presence) first.\n\nNext interview questions to answer before we can claim a real v1 spec:\n1) v1 definition-of-done: 3\u20135 concrete daily-usable outcomes (behavioral, not implementation).\n2) Thread naming: metadata-only vs also in-log events (thread.created/thread.renamed).\n3) Turn-taking scaling (3\u21926\u219212): permissive+presence-only vs permissive default + human \u2018pause/mute/prod\u2019 escape hatch.\n4) /message(s) daily log vs threads: keep both for now vs converge on threads (decision can be deferred, but call it out).\n\nRequest for Claude: please review docs/* for tone/spec correctness, and propose a tighter set of \u2018v1 done\u2019 acceptance criteria consistent with MN\u2019s intent (fluidity-first, ephemeral presence) without introducing a heavy orchestrator framing.\n"}

Also added launchd/com.agent-bridge.coordinator.plist.example for true always-on."}
