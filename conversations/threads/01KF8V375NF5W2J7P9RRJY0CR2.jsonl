And if they're not getting the nudge, then they're not gonna be able to respond. I suppose that's how it works. And in time, if we find too main agents are trying to chime in after I send one message and then everyone thinks they have to reply, we'll just figure out a simple protocol to be followed before every message is sent and then put a hook in front of it. And it should simply help that agent to consider whether or not based on the messages that have been flooding in since they last responded is now the right time to say something for them to say something. If it were a human or a group of humans, it would be obvious to the participants when is the right time to say something and when isn't, but everyone hears everything and anyone can interject or interact any time. And a conversation is pleasant when you know the others are responsive and able to actually participate. That's what fluidity is."}

It might involve a\n  system prompt outlining its role, thread ID, and messaging instructions for the\n  bridge. This could be accomplished by generating a shell command and using osascript.\n  The server should also provide an endpoint for spawning agents. We need to carefully\n  design the invitation system and clarify the difference between participants and\n  presence, as presence isn't persistent across sessions.\n\n  Refining agent invitations\n\n  It sounds like the user wants the ability to invite different agents in each thread,\n  rather than having them always included. In version one, the coordinator has\n  configured agents that are \"available,\" and inviting would add them to the thread's\n  auto-invoke set. While the coordinator handles presence, it doesn't automatically\n  invoke agents for all messages. I could manage a per-thread participant list with\n  relevant metadata to align with the user's preferences for clients, models, and\n  nicknames. It\u2019s also important that invited profiles respect the data in the user's\n  configuration registry.\n\n  Considering registry and security\n\n  I\u2019m questioning whether we should load the registry directly on the server. Instead, I\n  could read the YAML and expose it via a safe UI endpoint like /registry. For now, it\n  might make sense to implement it just for codex and claude since the user specifically\n  requested it. Security is critical here, especially because the server doesn't have\n  authentication. If we add an endpoint for executing commands, it must be secure.\n  Having a CORS setting that allows all origins creates a significant vulnerability,\n  since it could let remote websites send requests to execute commands locally.\n\n  Addressing security and user requests\n\n  I need to tighten CORS settings or require tokens for execution endpoints due to\n  security concerns. For starting a terminal, I think we should avoid server initiation\n  if security isn't resolved. A safer approach could be providing a copyable command\n  rather than executing it directly. The user has expressed a strong desire to invite\n  agents through the UI, so I can implement a feature that allows auto-invokes for\n  invited agents without spawning terminals. While we need to maintain security, the\n  focus should be on making the communication fluid and efficient.\n\n  Refining participant invitations\n\n  To avoid noise, I understand that invited participants should reply in a conversation\n  thread. The invite essentially manages how messages are broadcasted within a thread. I\n  see that when a user sends a message to everyone without mentioning anyone, the\n  coordinator should invoke invited participants who are not muted or paused, but\n  threading paused should still allow user messages. We need to decide if invitations\n  should be ephemeral or persistent, likely persisting through control events.\n  Additionally, it makes sense for invitations to include participant IDs and their\n  associated roles while maintaining a streamlined control event schema.\n\"  and \"\n\u2022 It's time to move forward with implementing invites, but first, I need the user to\n  decide on options. They haven't replied yet, but I\u2019m thinking about planning and\n  potentially implementing Option A and B. I want to confirm their preferences since\n  they mentioned they can't read walls, but we could propose quickly.\n\n  I could implement Option A with an invite list and an auto-invoke feature while\n  letting them copy commands. I think maintaining momentum is key, so I might go ahead\n  and implement both options without waiting for a response.\n\n  Planning invite implementation\n\n  The user has explicitly agreed with the next steps and requested invites, so it's time\n  to implement that. They need invites to kick off a terminal with the assigned agent\n  and the right prompt to use the bridge. That suggests I should implement copy commands\n  for spawning in the terminal.\n\n  We also need to integrate the ai-registry file to fill in client and model options in\n  the UI invite panel. The panel should display clients like Claude, Codex, and Gemini,\n  starting with predetermined selections. I can set up a server endpoint to read the\n  YAML file and return the necessary lists.\n\n  Checking PyYAML dependency\n\n  I need to verify if the PyYAML dependency is available. The server might just use\n  standard libraries, and it potentially lacks support for YAML. Can I parse YAML\n  manually? It seems I could use the yaml module if it\u2019s installed, but I\u2019m not entirely\n  sure.\n\n  I should also check the requirements.txt file to see if it only includes Flask or if\n  there's any mention of the YAML library. It's important to clarify that before\n  proceeding!\n\n\u2022 Explored\n  \u2514 Read requirements.txt\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m looking into different ways to parse YAML files. One idea is to use a minimal\n  parser that can handle the structure, focusing on key-value pairs and nested maps.\n  However, parsing could get tricky with lists, maps, and comments in play. An\n  alternative is converting YAML to JSON using Python, but I\u2019m not sure if the necessary\n  tools like yq or ruamel.yaml are installed. I\u2019ll need to check if I can import YAML\n  using Python. Let's test that!\"  --> well make sure it is all in an implimentation plan/spec!"}
